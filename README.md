What the Program Does

Lets you add tasks

Lets you see all tasks

Lets you remove a task by number

Lets you exit the program


How It Works

The program shows a menu with 4 options.

You pick what you want to do by typing the number (1–4).

Tasks are stored in an ArrayList.

Input is handled with Scanner.

I added some checks so if the user types something wrong, the program won’t crash.



Example..
=== Welcome to the To Do List Manager ===

Please choose an option:
1. Add a new task
2. View all tasks
3. Remove a task
4. Exit

Enter choice: 1
Enter your new task: Study for exam
Task added! 


Main program file ---ToDoListManager.java
